### Solver

Solver is an experimental finite volume and discontinous galerkin code 
for solving partial differential equations.

### Build

To build Solver type

    make

followed by

    make install

This will install three tools for pre-processing, solution and post-processing.
The tool 'mesh' generates the grid, 'solver' does the solution and 'prepare' does
various post-processing.
